   4  Abstract: This paper develops a trade model in which AI compute is produced and traded internationally. Latency-insensitive AI training can be offshored to the lowest-cost producers, while latency-sensitive inference favors proximity to users; a sovereignty premium captures governments’ preference for domestic data processing. Calibration across 86 countries shows that energy-abundant economies have a comparative advantage in training compute, while regional inference hubs form around major demand centers. Because hardware costs are globally uniform, cross-country cost differences are small, making institutional quality, reliability, and policy constraints decisive for the location of compute facilities. For energy-rich developing countries with limited export diversification, compute exports offer a pathway to convert natural resources into high-value digital services and integrate into the global economy.

   7  1. Introduction
   8  The expansion of artificial intelligence drives the demand for computational resources. The compute used to train the largest AI models has been doubling every six months since 2010 (Epoch AI 2024). Data centers accounted for approximately 1.5% of global electricity demand in 2024—more than the electricity consumption of France—a share projected to more than double by 2030 (IEA 2025). AI-oriented facilities are qualitatively different from traditional cloud or enterprise data centers. They deploy thousands of GPUs at power densities of 40–100 kW per rack (versus 5–10 kW in conventional facilities), and can consume over 500,000 gallons of cooling water per day (Turner Lee and West 2025).
   9  This surge in demand for compute creates a new type of export opportunity. This paper refers to the production of compute services in one country for consumption in another as FLOP exporting. FLOP exporting is a form of value chain upgrading. Rather than exporting raw energy resources as primary commodities, countries can convert electricity into a higher value-added digital service. For resource-rich developing countries, FLOP exporting could offer a route up the value chain without the heavy industrialization traditionally required for such upgrading (Hausmann, Hwang, and Rodrik 2007).
  10  The opportunity is particularly relevant for the Europe and Central Asia (ECA) region. Several ECA countries, including Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, and the countries of the South Caucasus, have among the world’s lowest electricity prices but limited integration into the global digital economy. Building data centers in these locations and selling compute services to high-cost markets could generate export revenue, attract foreign investment, and accelerate the development of digital infrastructure. Export-oriented capacity can also later serve the domestic market as local AI demand grows.
  11  Recent megaprojects across Africa, the Middle East, and Central Asia suggest that FLOP exporting is technically and commercially feasible. Armenia is deploying 50,000 GPUs in a $4 billion investment (Firebird 2026), while Kenya, Saudi Arabia, Morocco, Malaysia, and Indonesia have each attracted billion-dollar data center commitments. Cloud computing exports already exceed $9 billion annually, with the United States accounting for 87% of the global total (World Bank 2025). A 40 MW data center in Kyrgyzstan could generate annual revenue of $630–950 million at wholesale contract rates, equivalent to over 15% of Kyrgyzstan’s $3.8 billion in goods exports (World Bank 2024).
  12  Recent work examines compute governance and the geography of AI infrastructure (Sastry et al. 2024, Lehdonvirta et al. 2024, Pilz et al. 2025), but no formal trade model of compute exists. This paper offers the first such model, treating FLOPs as commodities produced and exported according to Ricardian comparative advantage. The paper makes three contributions. First, it develops a capacity-constrained Ricardian model in which countries produce and export compute services, facing an iceberg trade cost that captures inference latency degradation and a sovereignty premium reflecting governments’ preference for domestic data processing. Capacity ceilings generate market-clearing prices and scarcity rents, yielding predictions about market concentration, export patterns, and the value of grid expansion. Second, it calibrates the model for 86 countries using data on electricity prices, climate, data center construction costs, and inter-country network latency, correcting for energy subsidies that distort headline cost rankings. Third, it characterizes the resulting trade regimes—which countries export, which import, and which adopt hybrid strategies—and quantifies the welfare cost of the sovereignty premium.
  13  The calibration reveals that cheap electricity and favorable cooling conditions are necessary but not sufficient for competitive compute exporting. Hardware amortization accounts for over 80 percent of the cost of a unit of compute and is identical across countries, compressing the total cost spread to roughly 20 percent across 86 countries. Since electricity and construction account for only a small share of total cost, cross-country cost differences are narrow. Once reliability penalties for grid outages, weak governance, and sanctions exposure are applied, the cost ranking changes substantially. Several energy-abundant but institutionally fragile economies fall out of the top tier, replaced by countries with more reliable grids and stronger institutions at moderately higher energy costs. Durable comparative advantage requires credible reliability and institutional quality alongside low energy costs.
  14  The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the related literature. Section 3 develops the model, covering production technology, trade costs, demand, and the capacity-constrained market equilibrium. Section 4 derives the equilibrium properties, including propositions on country taxonomy, concentration, sovereignty thresholds, and the nesting of training within inference exporters. Section 5 describes the data. Section 6 calibrates the model and discusses the results. Section 7 concludes.
  15  2. Related Literature
  16  Goldfarb and Trefler (2018) argue that AI shifts comparative advantage toward countries with data, human capital, and institutional capacity. Our model introduces a complementary mechanism where comparative advantage in compute production depends on electricity costs and climate, so resource-rich countries could become compute exporters without domestic AI research industries. Korinek and Stiglitz (2021) suggest that developing countries could be left behind in the AI revolution. FLOP exporting offers a pathway for energy-rich developing countries to participate in that revolution. The concept of FLOP exporting as value chain upgrading connects to Hausmann, Hwang, and Rodrik (2007), who show that what a country exports matters for growth. Limão and Venables (2001) demonstrate that infrastructure quality determines trade costs. In our model, network infrastructure plays the analogous role for digital trade.
  17  Several studies examine the determinants of data center location. Flucker, Tozer, and Whitehead (2013) show that climate affects data center cooling costs. Oltmanns et al. (2021) model data center location as a function of electricity prices, climate, connectivity, and political stability. Liu et al. (2023) study data center placement under renewable energy constraints. These studies focus on where firms should build data centers. In international trade theory, Brainard (1997) formalizes the proximity-concentration trade-off between serving a market locally and concentrating production abroad, and Helpman, Melitz, and Yeaple (2004) extend this to heterogeneous firms choosing between exporting and FDI.
  18  On the governance side, Sastry, et al. (2024) argue that compute is well-suited for regulation because governments can track the number of chips in circulation, restrict who can buy them, and measure how much computation they perform. Lehdonvirta, et al. (2024) map the global geography of cloud GPU infrastructure, distinguishing a “Compute North” with training-capable hardware from a “Compute South” limited to inference-grade chips. Pilz et al. (2025) project that AI data center power demand could reach 327 GW by 2030 and that domestic power shortages may push compute infrastructure abroad. The World Bank (2025) documents the resulting global compute divide: high-income countries hold 77% of colocation data center capacity and account for 87% of cloud computing exports (Stojkoski et al. 2024), but the report offers descriptive evidence without a formal framework linking production costs to trade patterns. On the industrial organization side, Biglaiser et al. (2024) survey the economics of cloud markets, including switching costs, egress fees, and platform competition among hyperscalers, but the supply-side question of where compute is produced and whether developing countries can become competitive exporters has not been addressed.
  19  3. Model Setup
  20  The existing literature documents where compute infrastructure is located and who controls it, but no formal framework links production costs to trade patterns. This section models compute as a tradable good with country-specific production costs, a delivery cost that depends on whether the workload is training (latency-insensitive) or inference (latency-sensitive), and a sovereignty premium reflecting governments’ preference for domestic production.
  21  3.1 Production Technology and Cost Structure
  22  Consider  countries, each capable of producing compute services. The cost of producing a unit of compute in country  depends on three inputs: electricity, hardware, and data center construction.
  23  A data center consumes electricity not only for its GPUs but also for cooling, power distribution, and lighting. This overhead is measured by the power usage effectiveness (PUE), the ratio of total facility power to IT equipment power. The total cost per GPU-hour in country  is:
  24  where  is GPU power draw (kW),  is the electricity price ($/kWh),  is amortized hardware cost per GPU-hour ( = purchase price,  = lifetime in years,  = 8,766 hours per year,  = utilization rate),  is amortized networking cost (high-speed interconnect such as InfiniBand), and the last term amortizes construction costs  ($/W of IT capacity) over the facility’s lifetime . Both  and  are determined in global hardware markets and are common across countries. Cross-country variation in  is therefore driven by electricity prices, climate, and construction costs.
  25  Countries export goods intensive in their abundant factors (Ohlin 1933). For compute production, the relevant endowment is not electricity per se but the natural resources that generate it—hydropower reservoirs (Kyrgyzstan, Ethiopia, Georgia), oil and gas (Iran, Turkmenistan, Qatar), solar irradiance (North Africa, the Gulf), and geothermal energy (Kenya, Iceland). The electricity price  in equation (1) is therefore a reduced-form expression for country ’s energy resource endowment.
  26  3.2 Trade Costs
  27  Countries produce and trade two types of compute services that differ in their offshoring costs. Training services encompass batch workloads such as model training, fine-tuning, and large-scale data processing. Training a state-of-the-art AI model can take weeks to months across thousands of GPUs. The client ships its data to a data center, the computation executes locally, and the output is returned to the client. Since neither input nor output is time-sensitive, network latency plays no role. Inference services encompass real-time workloads such as chatbot responses, autonomous decisions, and interactive agents. Each query must travel to the server and back within milliseconds, so the service degrades as delivery delays increase. Latency, denoted , is the round-trip time for a data packet to travel from seller  to buyer , typically 5–10 ms within a country and over 150 ms across continents.
  28  Governments and firms may prefer to process data domestically for national security, regulatory compliance, or political reasons. This is captured by a sovereignty premium , which acts as a proportional markup on the cost of foreign-sourced compute. When a country sources compute from a foreign seller, the effective cost is inflated by the factor . The sovereignty premium is zero for domestic production.
  29  The delivered cost of service  from seller  to buyer  is:
  30  where  if  and  if .  is a reliability index that captures institutional factors, such as grid outages, regulatory unpredictability, and sanctions risk, that reduce effective output. It approaches one for countries with stable institutions and reliable power, and falls well below one where outages or sanctions reduce effective delivery. The parameter  measures the rate of quality degradation per millisecond of round-trip latency, with  and . This iceberg formulation parallels Hummels and Schaur (2013), who estimate that each day of shipping time is equivalent to a tariff; here, milliseconds replace days. For training (), the delivered cost reduces to the production cost plus the sovereignty markup; distance plays no role. Inference also faces a hard latency ceiling: beyond a threshold  (typically 200–300 ms for interactive applications) the service becomes unusable regardless of price, modeled as  if .
  31  3.3 Global Compute Demand
  32  The model is closed by specifying demand for compute services. Let  denote the volume of compute purchased by buyer . The paper measures compute demand using installed data center capacity in megawatts (MW), compiled from industry sources as follows:
  33  where  is total global compute spending and  is country ’s share of global demand, measured by its share of installed data center capacity (MW). Since all results below depend only on demand shares, not on the absolute level , the calibration does not require an estimate of total global compute spending.
  34  Demand splits between training and inference. Training demand is  and inference demand is , where  is the exogenous training share. The parameter  should be interpreted as the share of compute that is fully latency-insensitive and freely offshorable; the effective offshorable share may be smaller as intermediate workloads (agentic inference, fine-tuning) grow.
  35  3.4 Sourcing and Market Equilibrium
  36  For each service type , each buyer  chooses the source that minimizes the delivered cost:
  37  Each country  is characterized by a capacity ceiling , measured in GPU-hours per period, representing the maximum volume of compute the country can supply. This ceiling reflects the joint constraint of grid electricity availability, institutional capacity for data center permitting and construction, and access to GPU financing.
  38  Training market. Since , training is a homogeneous good with no distance-related quality degradation. Country  imports training whenever the world price, even after adding the sovereignty premium, is cheaper than producing domestically: , where  is the competitive world training price. Following Dornbusch, Fischer, and Samuelson (1977), countries are ranked by production cost: . In the capacity-constrained equilibrium, exporters fill demand in cost order, with country (1) supplying up to its capacity, then country (2), and so on. The marginal training exporter  is the index at which cumulative capacity first meets export demand. The equilibrium training price equals the marginal exporter’s cost: .
  39  Without capacity constraints,  and the cheapest country serves all demand at its own cost, earning zero rent. With binding capacity constraints, , the price rises to the cost of the marginal entrant, and all infra-marginal exporters earn strictly positive Ricardian rents: . For a capacity-constrained exporter, the shadow value  of the grid constraint equals the margin on the least profitable active use, measuring the incremental gain from relaxing the capacity ceiling by one GPU-hour.
  40  Inference market. Since , inference suffers distance-dependent quality degradation. The inference market for buyer  is localized, as only countries with latency  can participate, and each faces a different delivered cost. The delivered inference price for buyer  is:
  41  where  is the marginal inference supplier to , determined by the capacity-constrained supply stack for ’s inference market. Each GPU-hour of capacity is allocated to its highest-margin use, whether training exports, inference exports to various destinations, or domestic supply. The aggregate rent function (derived in Appendix B) is concave and piecewise linear in total capacity deployed.
  42  4. Equilibrium Properties
  43  This section derives the formal properties of the capacity-constrained equilibrium defined in Section 3. Full derivations appear in Appendix B.
  44  Proposition 1 (Country Taxonomy). In equilibrium, each country falls into exactly one of three regimes: (i) exporter (), when the country supplies compute to the world market up to its capacity, (ii) domestic producer (), when the sovereignty premium makes domestic production cheaper than importing, and (iii) importer (), when even with the sovereignty markup, foreign compute is cheaper. The three cases partition the cost space and are mutually exclusive.
  45  Proposition 2 (Capacity Constraints Reduce Concentration). Define the Herfindahl–Hirschman Index (HHI), a standard measure of market concentration equal to the sum of squared market shares, for training market concentration as . Without capacity constraints, the cheapest producer captures all training demand and . With binding capacity constraints on the cheapest producers, , and  is strictly decreasing in the number of capacity-constrained infra-marginal exporters (U.S. DOJ and FTC 2010). Intuitively, when cheap producers hit capacity limits, residual demand spills over to costlier suppliers, spreading market shares more evenly. The proof follows from the strict Cauchy-Schwarz inequality when at least two producers hold positive market shares.
  46  Proposition 3 (Sovereignty Switching Threshold). A country will bear the additional cost of domestic AI training only if its sovereignty premium is large enough to justify the price premium over cheaper foreign producers. Formally, country  produces training domestically if and only if . The threshold is increasing in  and decreasing in . Under capacity constraints, , so the threshold is lower than in the unconstrained model. Capacity constraints reduce the sovereignty premium required for domestic production because a higher world price makes imports more expensive.
  47  Proposition 4 (Shadow Value and Grid Expansion). For a capacity-constrained exporter, the shadow value  of the grid constraint equals the margin on the least profitable active use (Section 3.4). Grid expansion is warranted if and only if the amortized per-GPU-hour cost of grid infrastructure  satisfies . This follows directly from the concavity of the rent function.
  48  Proposition 5 (Training Exporters Nest Within Inference Exporters). If a country is cheap enough to export training (which can be done from anywhere), it is also cheap enough to export inference to nearby demand centers. The set of training exporters is therefore a subset of inference exporters for demand centers within the latency threshold . A training exporter has the globally lowest . For inference to proximate demand centers, this cost advantage dominates the latency markup, so the same country wins the inference competition. Since training has no distance penalty while inference does, every country that exports training is also competitive in inference within its geographic neighborhood, but not vice versa.
  49  Welfare cost of sovereignty. The sovereignty premium imposes a welfare cost with two components, an import markup (importers pay  per unit above the competitive price) and an allocative inefficiency (countries with  produce domestically at above-world-price costs). Under capacity constraints, both components are smaller than in the unconstrained model because the higher world price narrows the gap between domestic and import costs.
  50  5. Data
  51  Calibrating the production-cost and trade-cost parameters in equations (2) and (3) requires data on electricity prices, temperatures, construction costs, and bilateral latencies. Electricity prices. For European countries, the paper uses Eurostat industrial electricity prices in the 20,000–69,999 MWh consumption band, which corresponds to large industrial consumers (Eurostat 2025). For non-European countries, the paper uses national regulator tariff sheets and secondary sources, including the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA 2025) for the United States, KEPCO for South Korea, national utility tariffs for Central Asian countries (Barki Tojik, AERA, Ministry of Energy of Uzbekistan), and GlobalPetrolPrices (2025) for the remaining countries. All prices are converted to $/kWhat 2024 average exchange rates.
  52  Temperature and construction. Peak summer temperature for each country is computed from ERA5 reanalysis data (Hersbach et al. 2020) as the average monthly maximum in the three warmest months, aggregated across populated grid cells. Data center construction costs per watt of IT capacity are from the Turner & Townsend Data Centre Construction Cost Index 2025 (Turner & Townsend 2025), which covers 37 countries. For the remaining countries, costs are predicted using a log-linear regression of ln($/W) on GDP per capita, population, urbanization, seismic risk, and regional dummies (Appendix E). Since construction is only 3–6% of total per-GPU-hour costs, imputation error has a limited impact on cost rankings. Costs are amortized over 15 years. The per-GPU construction cost in equation (1) equals 700 W (the GPU thermal design power) times the build cost per watt.
  53  Latency. Inter-country round-trip latency is measured using WonderNetwork’s global ping dataset (WonderNetwork 2024). For each country pair, the median round-trip time (RTT) in milliseconds is used. Domestic latency defaults to 5 ms where no intra-country measurement is available. These measurements reflect today’s network infrastructure. New undersea cables, terrestrial fiber, and CDN expansions could cut bilateral latencies enough to redraw inference trade patterns, opening distant low-cost producers to markets they cannot currently reach.
  54  Hardware. The calibration uses the NVIDIA H100 SXM GPU as the reference hardware platform, with a list price of $25,000, a thermal design power of 700W, an economic lifetime of 3 years, and a utilization rate 70% (Barroso, Hölzle, and Ranganathan 2018; NVIDIA 2024). Google’s fleet-wide GPU utilization, after years of optimization with custom schedulers and workload packing, runs in the 60–75% range (Barroso, Hölzle, and Ranganathan 2018). A new entrant in Central Asia would likely achieve 40–60% utilization in the early years, roughly doubling the effective hardware cost per useful GPU-hour. This yields an amortized hardware cost /hr. Networking costs are calibrated at /hr, based on the amortized cost of InfiniBand interconnect fabric per GPU over the same three-year horizon (Barroso, Hölzle, and Ranganathan 2018). Like hardware, networking equipment is procured at uniform global prices, so this term does not affect cross-country cost rankings. GPU prices are assumed to be uniform across countries. In practice, export controls, logistics costs, insurance, and local distribution markups can raise effective GPU prices by 5–15% in developing countries. A 10% GPU price premium would add roughly $0.10/hr to unit costs, substantially eroding the thin cost advantages documented in Table A2. This assumption thus favors developing-country exporters and should be kept in mind when interpreting the calibration results.
  55  GPU vintage. The calibration uses the NVIDIA H100, but successor GPUs (B200, shipping 2025) draw approximately 1,000W versus 700W and deliver roughly four times the training throughput. Higher power draw widens the absolute electricity cost gap across countries, modestly strengthening developing-country comparative advantage. However, late entrants selling older-generation GPU-hours must discount to compete with competitors using newer hardware, potentially eroding their cost edge. The cost structure is stable across generations—hardware amortization remains 80–85 percent of total cost—so the qualitative findings, including the narrow cross-country spread and the dominance of institutional factors, are robust to hardware choice.
  56  Other parameters. The latency degradation parameter is set at , implying that 100 ms of latency inflates inference cost by 8%. This value is calibrated to match the observed willingness of cloud providers to invest in regional points of presence. At , a latency difference of 100 ms (roughly the intercontinental round-trip between Europe and East Asia) imposes an 8% cost penalty, consistent with industry evidence that web-service revenue declines by approximately 1% per 100 ms of additional latency. The sovereignty premium is . The training share of compute demand is , within the industry range of 0.4–0.6 (Deloitte 2025).
  57  Reliability. The reliability index  from equation (2) is constructed as the product of three normalized scores for governance quality (World Bank Worldwide Governance Indicators, Rule of Law percentile, rescaled to [0, 1]), grid reliability (inverse of hours without electricity per firm per year, from the World Bank Enterprise Surveys), and sanctions exposure (0 for unrestricted, 0.5 for comprehensive sanctions). For OECD countries with negligible outages and no sanctions, . For countries under heavy sanctions (Iran, Russia, Belarus), . Developing countries with weak grids and governance fall in between. Note that even countries with  can shift in rank after reliability adjustment: penalizing low-ξ competitors pushes them down, mechanically raising higher-ξ countries. Moreover, ξ ranges from 0.95 to 1.00 even within the OECD, and the tight cross-country cost spread (≈20%) means small reliability differences reshuffle adjacent ranks.
  58  Demand. Compute demand  is proxied by installed data center capacity in MW, as specified in equation (3). For the top 15 markets, capacity estimates come from industry reports (Synergy Research, Cushman & Wakefield, CBRE, Mordor Intelligence). For smaller markets, capacity is estimated from facility counts and regional averages. The five largest demand centers (United States of America (43%), China (26%), India (2.9%), Canada (3%), and Australia (2%)) account for 77% of global demand. MW capacity captures the scale of compute infrastructure more accurately than facility counts. Chinese data centers, though fewer in number (449 in Cloudscene), are substantially larger on average, and IEA (2025) data confirm that China accounts for roughly 25% of global data center electricity consumption compared with 44% for the United States. Table 1 reports all model parameters.
  59  6. Calibration and Discussion
  60  The model is calibrated for  countries (30 in ECA, 55 non-ECA comparators). The unit cost  represents the total hourly cost of operating one GPU in country , measured in dollars per GPU-hour ($/hr). The PUE parameters are calibrated as follows. The baseline  matches Google’s reported fleet-wide PUE for facilities with free-air cooling in cold climates (Uptime Institute 2024). The sensitivity coefficient  per °C is estimated from cross-sectional variation in PUE across data center locations with different cooling loads (Liu et al. 2023). The threshold  is the approximate outdoor temperature above which mechanical cooling is needed, below which free-air cooling suffices. Together, these yield PUE values from 1.08 (Iceland, Scandinavia) to 1.41 (UAE), consistent with the industry range of 1.1–1.6 reported by the Uptime Institute.
  61  Table A2 in the Appendix reports the full results for all  countries. The paper’s preferred specification applies cost-recovery electricity prices (replacing subsidized tariffs with long-run marginal cost) and adjusts for institutional reliability using the index  defined in equation (2). Under this specification, the five cheapest producers are Canada ($1.61/hr), Norway ($1.62/hr), Finland ($1.62/hr), Sweden ($1.63/hr), and Iceland ($1.64/hr). Nine of the ten cheapest countries under the pure engineering cost ranking fall out of the top ten after reliability adjustment, replaced by countries with stronger institutions and more reliable grids. Because hardware and networking costs account for roughly 94% of engineering costs and are identical everywhere, the cross-country cost spread is narrow (about 20%). Even modest institutional penalties are large relative to this thin margin, so governance quality can easily dominate the cost ranking. An engineering cost advantage is therefore necessary but not sufficient for FLOP exporting. Figure 1 illustrates the resulting rank reshuffling.
  62  For comparison, under observed electricity tariffs and without reliability adjustment, the cheapest producer is Iran ($1.41/hr), followed by Turkmenistan ($1.42/hr) and Ethiopia ($1.43/hr). But this ranking is misleading. Iran’s headline cost rests on electricity priced at $0.005/kWh, a figure sustained by one of the world’s largest fossil fuel subsidies. Turkmenistan, Algeria, Qatar, and several other low-cost producers face similar distortions. Once subsidies are removed and institutional reliability is factored in, the ranking changes substantially.
  63  To distinguish genuine comparative advantage from fiscal artifact, the calibration replaces subsidized tariffs with cost-recovery prices, defined as the long-run marginal cost (LRMC) of the dominant generation technology at opportunity-cost fuel prices (IMF 2025, Lazard 2025). This adjustment is applied to 13 countries whose retail electricity prices fall below the estimated LRMC. Hydropower producers (Kyrgyzstan, Canada, Norway) are not adjusted because their low prices reflect genuine resource advantages rather than fiscal transfers. The resulting cost-recovery ranking serves as the baseline for the preferred specification. The five cheapest producers become Kyrgyzstan ($1.58/hr), Canada ($1.59/hr), Ethiopia ($1.59/hr), Kosovo ($1.60/hr), and Tajikistan ($1.60/hr). A sovereignty premium  shifts the majority of countries to domestic production. The sovereignty premium is particularly powerful for inference, since the latency markup within Europe is moderate (10–40 ms, adding 1–3%), and even a small domestic preference can tip the decision away from importing.
  64  In practice,  is bilateral and heterogeneous. Between allies with mutual data adequacy agreements (e.g., EU member states), the effective sovereignty premium may be near zero. Between geopolitical adversaries, it is effectively infinite—the United States would not source training from Iran regardless of cost, and current sanctions make such transactions illegal. The uniform  should therefore be understood as an average over non-adversarial country pairs. In a model with bilateral , sanctioned countries would be excluded from serving most demand centers. Under cost-recovery prices, Iran is already outside the top ten, so sanctions reinforce rather than alter the cost-recovery ranking.
  65  The country-specific switching threshold  from Section 4 varies widely across the calibration. Near-frontier countries, whose production costs are close to the cheapest global supplier, switch to domestic production with minimal sovereignty premia. Kyrgyzstan requires only , China 0.8%, and the United States 2.6%. High-cost countries require much larger premia. Germany needs  and Japan 6.9%. Countries with high  face large cost penalties from sovereignty-driven domestic sourcing.
  66  Trade flows under capacity constraints. Weighting the sourcing patterns by demand shares from equation (3) and applying capacity constraints from Section 3.4, the equilibrium training price is /hr, set by the marginal exporter’s cost. Training demand is served by 2 exporters (HHI = 0.93), confirming Proposition 2. The largest shadow values of grid capacity are Kyrgyzstan ($0.014/hr), consistent with Proposition 4. Inference is more dispersed, with the top five suppliers being Canada (46%), Kyrgyzstan (26%), Kosovo (6%), United Kingdom (3%), India (3%), collectively accounting for 84% of global inference demand (HHI = 0.29). Under the 10% sovereignty premium, most training demand is served domestically, and the smaller export market is served by 1 exporter (HHI = 1.00) at $1.58/hr.
  67  Among developing countries, Kyrgyzstan captures 26% of global inference demand by serving China, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan, a large share for a country with a GDP of under $15 billion. Kosovo serves as an inference hub for 17 countries, accounting for 6% of global inference demand. These results are illustrative, not forecasts. They show the cost structure that would make FLOP exporting viable, not that specific countries will necessarily capture these market shares. Cheap-energy developing countries can, in principle, earn export revenue from much larger economies.
  68  Under cost-recovery pricing, the narrow cost spread means that even a 10% sovereignty premium is sufficient to make domestic training viable for nearly all countries, leaving the share of global training demand available to foreign exporters negligible. Raising the premium to 20% shifts 1 additional country to domestic production, but the marginal effect is small. Inference exports are more resilient to sovereignty premia because the latency advantage of proximity partially insulates regional hubs.
  69  Major demand centers. The model’s predictions vary across major AI demand centers because each faces a different latency geography. For the United States, the cost-recovery optimum sources training from the cheapest available producer and inference from Canada ($1.66/hr). For Germany, inference is sourced from Kosovo ($1.65/hr), for the United Kingdom from United Kingdom ($1.66/hr), and for France from Kosovo ($1.66/hr). For China, the cheapest inference source is Kyrgyzstan ($1.63/hr), a bordering country with hydropower-based electricity. These patterns illustrate the model’s core prediction that inference organizes around latency-bounded regional hubs, and each major market has a distinct optimal supplier determined by geography. With a sovereignty premium of 10%, most large economies shift to full domestic production.
  70  Governance and political economy. These cost rankings assume globally uniform hardware prices and abstract from institutional heterogeneity. In practice, GPU export controls raise effective  for Iran, Russia, and Belarus, and grid reliability varies widely. Data center investments are large, long-lived, and immobile, so the viability of a country as a compute exporter depends on institutional factors not captured by  alone. Several of the cheapest producers in the calibration (Iran, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan) rank poorly on property rights and rule of law indices, and subsidized electricity prices may be politically fragile. Effective entry barriers are therefore higher than production costs alone suggest. The World Bank (2025) frames this as the central policy choice: whether to build domestic compute capacity or secure affordable access to international cloud services, a trade-off the present model formalizes through the sovereignty premium and capacity constraints.
  71  The EU’s GDPR and AI Act segment the compute market along regulatory lines, reinforcing the sovereignty premium  as a structural feature. U.S. export controls on advanced GPUs (October 2022 and October 2023 rules, expanded in 2025) create a hard binary constraint for certain jurisdictions—H100-class GPUs cannot legally be shipped there at all, making the relevant question availability rather than price. For countries not under outright bans but subject to per-chip caps, the effective hardware cost  rises through grey-market procurement, potentially offsetting any electricity cost advantage and discouraging long-term investment. As shown above, once reliability and governance are factored into costs, viable compute exporters are a strict subset of low-cost producers—those that combine cheap energy with adequate institutional quality, such as the Nordic countries, Canada, and parts of the Gulf and Central Asia. Water is another constraint. Evaporative cooling consumes large volumes, and several of the cheapest producers (Iran, Turkmenistan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia) are water-scarce. Liquid cooling reduces water needs but does not eliminate them.
  72  The sovereignty premium deserves scrutiny. Some domestic processing preference is justified for genuinely confidential data (e.g., military intelligence, health records, and national statistical systems). But much of the current policy push, particularly in the EU, extends the sovereignty logic far beyond these cases to cover routine commercial computation that carries no security risk. The welfare cost is not trivial. As shown above, a 10% premium already shifts most countries toward domestic production, forgoing the cost savings from specialization. Developing countries in Central Asia and Africa are likely to follow the EU template, imposing data localization requirements that their small markets cannot efficiently serve. A policy tension arises: the same countries whose cost advantages position them as natural FLOP exporters may simultaneously erect sovereignty barriers against importing compute from their neighbors, reducing the welfare gains from regional specialization that the model predicts.
  73  Subsidy adjustment. The cost-recovery prices are derived from country-specific LRMC estimates. For gas exporters (Iran, Turkmenistan, Algeria, Qatar), the calibration uses combined-cycle gas generation at export-parity fuel prices ($0.065–$0.100/kWh). For the Gulf states, it uses the opportunity cost of domestic gas combustion relative to LNG exports. For coal-dependent producers (Kazakhstan, South Africa), the calibration uses the Eskom-style cost-recovery tariff. For Ethiopia, it uses the IMF’s hydro cost-recovery target ($0.050/kWh). The subsidy gap ranges from $0.019 to $0.080/kWh. for Iran, a 100 MW data center would receive roughly $70 million per year in implicit fiscal transfer. At export scale, this fiscal arithmetic becomes unsustainable. Even cost-recovery prices may understate the true resource cost. Regulated tariffs in many developing countries cover operating expenses but not the full capital cost of generation, transmission, and distribution infrastructure. State-owned enterprises (SOEs) accumulate quasi-fiscal deficits that are eventually borne by taxpayers or future consumers. Allowing large-scale FLOP exports at these prices would accelerate infrastructure depreciation while the SOE cannot finance replacement, raising a fundamental question—is it politically sustainable to export compute while the domestic energy sector cannot maintain its capital stock? Governments ultimately face a choice between raising data center tariffs (eroding the cost advantage), maintaining subsidies at growing fiscal cost, or capping capacity. Iran drops from first to 24th. Eight countries change trade regime.
  74  Endogenous electricity prices. The model treats electricity prices as exogenous parameters. For large economies this is innocuous, but for the small, cheap-energy countries that rank highest in Table A2, a hyperscale data center can be large relative to the host grid. Kyrgyzstan’s installed generation capacity is approximately 3,500 MW, and a single 100 MW facility would consume roughly 5% of national electricity output, and at the multi-facility scale implied by the model’s export predictions, data centers would become the dominant industrial load. At that scale, the assumption of price-taking behaviour breaks down. Increased demand would bid up wholesale electricity prices, competing with residential heating in winter (when Kyrgyz hydropower output drops), and likely triggering regulatory intervention. The cheap electricity that attracts investment would be partially eroded by the investment itself. The capacity ceiling  partially addresses this concern by capping each country’s compute output, but within the feasible range, the model’s fixed-price assumption means that the cost advantages in Table A2 are upper bounds. A general equilibrium extension with upward-sloping electricity supply curves would compress these advantages further and narrow the set of viable exporters.
  75  Sensitivity analysis. The cost rankings in Table A2 are robust to substantial parameter variation. Across five scenarios—electricity prices ±$0.01/kWh, GPU price ±20%, and PUE capped at 1.20—the Spearman rank correlation with the baseline never falls below 0.992, the top five cheapest countries are unchanged in four of five scenarios, and the training price shifts by at most $0.272/hr. Table A3 in Appendix C reports the full results.
  76  Model extensions. The model can be extended in several directions. It can accommodate endogenous capacity investment, allowing countries to optimally choose their capacity ceiling rather than taking grid limits as given. It can incorporate stochastic disruptions such as grid outages or political instability, giving buyers a reason to diversify workloads across providers. Demand can be segmented by latency tolerance to capture heterogeneous service requirements. Carbon pricing can introduce a “green premium” that favors hydropower-rich countries. The framework can also accommodate strategic interaction among oligopolistic providers, and governance can enter as a multiplicative cost shifter on .
  77  Agglomeration and market structure. The competitive framework abstracts from the industrial organization of the cloud compute market, which is dominated by a small number of hyperscalers (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) with significant scale economies, proprietary networks, and market power. In practice, whether a country becomes a compute exporter depends not only on unit costs but on whether a hyperscaler or colocation provider chooses to invest there, a decision shaped by agglomeration economies, institutional quality, and network connectivity (Krugman 1991). The concentration of data centers in locations such as Northern Virginia reflects precisely these centripetal forces.
  78  The model’s contribution is to identify which countries satisfy the necessary cost condition for competitive supply. Even under increasing returns, hyperscalers expanding internationally will favor locations where electricity, cooling, and construction costs are lowest, conditional on meeting minimum infrastructure thresholds. The cost ranking in Table A2 thus identifies the feasibility frontier. Countries that are cost-competitive have a prerequisite for attracting investment, though cost competitiveness alone is not sufficient. The thin margins documented above (a 20% spread between cheapest and most expensive) reinforce this point. Since unit cost advantages are modest, institutional and agglomeration factors are often decisive in determining which cost-competitive countries attract investment.
  79  7. Conclusion
  80  This paper develops a capacity-constrained model of trade in computing services (FLOPs) in which countries produce and export computing capacity based on their energy-resource endowments, as reflected in electricity prices, climate, and construction costs. The model distinguishes two service types, latency-insensitive training and latency-sensitive inference, and introduces a sovereignty premium to capture governments’ preference for domestic data processing. Capacity ceilings transform the classical cost-based assignment into a framework with market-clearing prices and scarcity rents. The paper calibrates the model for 86 countries using data on electricity prices, temperatures, construction costs, bilateral latencies, and grid capacity.
  81  Across 86 countries, low-energy-cost countries export training compute, while inference is served by regional hubs close enough to users to meet latency requirements. The sovereignty premium rationalizes widespread domestic investment, shifting the majority of countries from import to domestic production, at a demand-weighted welfare cost of 6.0% of average compute spending, comparable in magnitude to the 1–10% welfare losses from trade barriers estimated for goods trade (Arkolakis, Costinot, and Rodríguez-Clare 2012). The model generates a country taxonomy (full importers, training exporters, inference hubs, and hybrid regimes) that maps onto observed investment patterns. This geographic structure is consistent with Lehdonvirta, Wu, and Hawkins (2024), who independently find that training-capable GPU infrastructure is concentrated in roughly 30 countries while the rest are limited to inference-grade hardware. A central finding is that electricity costs, while the main source of cross-country cost variation, are not the dominant determinant of actual data center location. Because hardware amortization is uniform and accounts for 94% of per-GPU-hour costs, the cost spread across countries is narrow—about 20%. Institutional quality, sovereignty preferences, and access to GPU hardware frequently outweigh these thin cost margins.
  82  For developing countries, the results point to a new avenue for economic participation in the global economy. Countries like Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, and Egypt, which rank among the cheapest FLOP producers in the calibration, could use their energy resource endowments—hydropower, natural gas, and solar irradiance—to convert cheap electricity into a high-value digital export without building a domestic AI research ecosystem. FLOP exporting is the digital equivalent of resource-based industrialization, but with the advantage that the underlying resource (electricity) need not deplete a finite reserve and the product (compute) serves the fastest-growing sector of the world economy. That said, the resource curse literature (van der Ploeg 2011) cautions that concentrated export revenues can produce Dutch disease, institutional degradation, and volatility. Whether FLOP exporting shares these risks depends on whether the revenues are broadly distributed or concentrated among a narrow set of actors, and on whether governments invest the proceeds in human capital and institutional development.
  83  The policy implications are asymmetric across training and inference. Training workloads tolerate high latency, so restricting training imports raises costs without offsetting proximity gains. Inference, by contrast, is latency-sensitive, giving domestic production a genuine quality-of-service advantage—though this rationale weakens for countries close to low-cost neighbors. For developing countries seeking to enter the compute export market, the binding constraints are not technological but institutional. Reliable power grids, political stability, data governance frameworks, and international connectivity determine whether cost advantages translate into actual exports.

 137  This appendix provides the full derivation of the capacity-constrained Ricardian model summarized in Sections 3–4.
 138  B.1 Primitives
 139  Each country  is endowed with a capacity ceiling  (GPU-hours per period), representing the maximum volume of compute it can supply. Country  faces unit production cost  from equation (1). On the demand side, total compute demand from country  is  from equation (3). Training demand is  and inference demand is . Countries are ordered by cost: .
 140  B.2 The Training Market
 141  Country  imports training if and only if . The set of training importers is  and total training export demand is . The marginal training exporter  is defined by:
 142  The equilibrium training price is . Training rent for country  with  is .
 143  B.3 The Inference Market
 144  The feasible supplier set for demand center  is . The marginal cost of delivering one effective unit of inference from  to  is:
 145  The inference rent per GPU-hour allocated to serving  is .
 146  B.4 Capacity Allocation
 147  Each GPU-hour is allocated to its highest-margin use. The margins per GPU-hour are: training exports ; inference exports to : . Total rent from operating  GPU-hours is:
 148  which is concave and piecewise linear in .
 149  B.5 Equilibrium Definition and Existence
 150  A competitive equilibrium consists of a training price , inference prices , and capacity allocations  such that: (i) each GPU-hour is allocated to its highest-margin use; (ii) training and inference markets clear; (iii) all allocations are feasible (). Existence follows from a fixed-point argument: the training supply curve is a step function with steps at  and widths ; intersection with the demand curve pins down .
 151  B.6 Welfare Cost of Sovereignty
 152  The welfare cost has two components. Import markup:
 153  Allocative inefficiency:
 154  Total: . Under capacity constraints, both components are smaller because the higher  narrows the gap between domestic and import costs.
 155  Appendix C: Sensitivity Analysis
 156  Table A3 reports equilibrium outcomes under five parameter perturbations. Rankings are robust because hardware amortization accounts for approximately 94 percent of total cost and is identical across countries. Only the electricity and construction components vary cross-country, and their combined share is too small for plausible perturbations to overturn the ordering.
 157  Table A3. Sensitivity of equilibrium outcomes to parameter variation
 158  Notes: Each row re-solves the capacity-constrained equilibrium under the stated parameter change. Spearman ρ is the rank correlation of country-level training costs with the baseline ordering. Top 5 indicates whether the five cheapest countries remain the same set in the same order. HHI is the Herfindahl–Hirschman Index of export concentration.
 159  Appendix D: Data Center Investment Model — Kyrgyzstan
 160  This appendix presents a 15-year discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis for a hypothetical 40 MW data center in Kyrgyzstan, the lowest-cost seller in the cost-recovery-adjusted calibration. All parameters are drawn from the calibration or from industry benchmarks.
 161  Table A4. Facility specification
 162  Notes: WACC = 60% × 15% (cost of equity) + 40% × 10% × (1 − 10%) (after-tax debt) = 12.6%. Cost of equity includes a 4% country risk premium and 6% emerging-market equity premium over the 5% risk-free rate.
 163  Table A5. Year-by-year cash flow ($ millions)
 164  The project yields an NPV of $353M at a 12.6% WACC, an IRR of 17.6%, and a simple payback in year 6. GPU hardware accounts for $5850M of the $6506M total CAPEX (90%), and electricity represents 53% of operating costs.
 165  Table A6. Sensitivity of investment returns to parameter variation
 166  Risks. Kyrgyzstan depends on the Toktogul reservoir for over 80% of electricity; seasonal drawdowns and drought years create acute power shortages. GPU procurement faces US export-control uncertainty. The reliability index assigns Kyrgyzstan a governance score of 0.50, reflecting underdeveloped contract enforcement and regulatory frameworks. Despite these risks, the engineering economics are clear: electricity at $0.038/kWh and a PUE of 1.08 yield production costs well below the global median, and the positive NPV survives all single-parameter perturbations in Table A6.
 167  Appendix E: Construction Cost Regression
 168  Data center construction costs per watt of IT capacity are observed for 37 countries from the Turner & Townsend Data Centre Construction Cost Index 2025 (52 markets). For the remaining countries, construction costs are predicted using the log-linear regression reported in Table A7. The dependent variable is ln($/W). Since construction accounts for only 3–6% of total per-GPU-hour costs, imputation error has limited impact on cost rankings.
