Summary of search:
  This paper does not appear to exist. An exhaustive search of the
  following sources found no matching publication:

  1. ACM Digital Library — e-Energy 2023 proceedings (DOI: 10.1145/3575813)
  2. DBLP — complete listing of e-Energy 2023 (https://dblp.org/db/conf/eenergy/eenergy2023.html)
  3. Google Scholar — searched by title, authors, and combinations
  4. arXiv — searched by authors and topic
  5. ResearchGate — searched by authors
  6. Adam Wierman's Caltech publication pages
  7. Yize Chen's publication pages

  The DBLP listing for e-Energy 2023 contains no paper by any of these
  authors. Neither "B. Raber" nor "J. Moriarty" appear as co-authors
  with Wierman or Liu in any data center publication.

  This citation has the hallmarks of an AI-generated (hallucinated)
  reference: plausible author names (Wierman and Liu are real data
  center researchers), a real venue (ACM e-Energy), and a specific
  but fabricated page range.
