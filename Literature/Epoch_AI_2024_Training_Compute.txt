Notes:
  The Epoch AI Notable AI Models dataset catalogues 3200+ ML models with
  training compute estimates, parameter counts, and dataset sizes. It is a
  continuously updated web resource (Creative Commons Attribution license)
  and does not have a single canonical PDF publication. The 2022 arXiv paper
  by Sevilla et al. is the closest formal academic reference describing the
  methodology and initial findings.
