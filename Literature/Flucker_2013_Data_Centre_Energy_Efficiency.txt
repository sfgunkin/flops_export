Abstract (from Crossref):
  The data centre industry grows with our increasing demand for IT services;
  energy forms a large part of data centre operating costs. Operators face
  increasing pressure to reduce their environmental impact and deliver
  competitively priced services to support users. However, many existing data
  centres were designed without a 'green' design brief; priorities were
  focussed around infrastructure redundancy. There are significant
  opportunities to implement modifications to design and operation and reduce
  operating costs, particularly to cooling systems, including managing data
  hall air, operating at higher temperatures, using free cooling and
  optimising for part load operation. Energy analysis can identify areas for
  improvement, often with short payback periods. This enables operators to
  realise massive reductions in energy (and sometimes capital) costs, whilst
  still delivering a reliable service.
